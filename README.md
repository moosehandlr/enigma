## Enigma Self Evaluation

#### Functionality - Meets Expectations
> Offsets classes able to produce random date and create offsets based on required algorithm. Keys class can produce a random 5 key as well as buffer any input value with less than 5 digits. Shifts class functionality works appropriately utilizing both offset values and key values to create shift values. Enigma class has functioning encrypt and decrypt methods. An input string results in an encrypted output string.

#### OOP - Meets Expectations / Above Expectations
> Project structure has 4 classes (Enigma, Shift, Keys, Offsets) none of which are abnormally small or large. Runner files are of appropriate size and function. Fileable module is utilized to provide methods to both runner files.

#### Ruby Convention & Mechanics - Meets Expectations
> Code is properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Most enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job. Multiple hashes have been implemented.

#### TDD - Meets Expectations
> Test coverage metrics show 100% test coverage. Every method was tested before method creation and re-tested during refactoring to completely verify method behavior.

#### Version Control - Meets Expectations
> Over 70 commits and 3 pull requests. Most pull requests name reflect the purpose of functionality and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
